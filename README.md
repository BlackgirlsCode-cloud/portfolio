# 👋 Hello, I'm Gracie

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases some of the Python projects and automation tools I’ve created to solve real-world problems and explore my interests in data, AI, and education.These scripts showcase how I approach automation and donor data analysis tasks that are typically handled within large CRM platforms like Salesforce or DonorPerfect. They are lightweight, modular, and ideal for organizations without access to enterprise tools or as augmentations to existing workflows
